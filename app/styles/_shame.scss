// Thanks https://github.com/heroheman/shepherd/blob/master/sass/_shame.scss
// ==========================================================================

// ==========================================================================
// because hacks happen.
//
// be very specific about what each piece of code is doing, and
// how to better fix it later
// ==========================================================================

// Try:  $ git blame _shame.scss

// Rules:
// ---------------
//   1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in _shame.scss.
//   2. Document all hacks fully:
//   3. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//   4. Why was this needed?
//   5. How does this fix it?
//   6. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
//   7. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
//   8. Try and clean _shame.scss up when you have some down time.
